savings/savings.py works with new pathstr reads paths from dst2changes pickle

mkchanges/mkchanges.py works with binary unified (path + baldb) data (converts
from mkchanges/dlib.py to mkchanges/path.py)

data/parser works with binary split (path separate from baldb) data (and
converts to intermediate text format)
